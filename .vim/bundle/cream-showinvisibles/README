Toggle view of invisible characters such as tabs, trailing spaces and hard returns. The script includes intuitive presets for these characters, a global environmental variable (g:LIST) that is retained and initialized across sessions if you use a viminfo, and a familiar (to some of us) keyboard shortcut mapping to F4.

This configuration includes characters as nice looking as your specific setup will allow, determined by hardware, operating system and Vim version. (Vim version 6.1.469 supports multi-byte characters, used with UTF-8 encoding.)

This is one of the many custom utilities and functions for gVim from the Cream project (http://cream.sourceforge.net), a configuration of Vim for those of us familiar with Apple and Windows software.
